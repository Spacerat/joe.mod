Advtext.mod provides a function for drawing text wrapped to a set width, and formatted with different colours/opacities, and functions for drawing centred text and text with shadows.

An example of text drawn by the text parser would be "<red>Roses are red, <blue>violets are blue,<br><black>Sugar is <pink>sweet,<black>And so are <shadow>you."
